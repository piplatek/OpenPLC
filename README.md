# OpenPLC

The aim of the project is to create a multi-platform universal software that will be a fully functional programmable logic controller. The project includes the implementation of system software for PC and ARM platforms as well as an advanced graphic editor to support STL, LAD and FBD languages. The design will be unlimited in order to enable cross-platform integration. Therefore, the necessary part will be to build a hardware platform as well as a platform to support OpenCAN, TCP / IP, RS485 communication.
